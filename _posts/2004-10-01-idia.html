For a software engineering class I am taking this semester, my group
decided to implement a visual graphing program called iDia. iDia is basically
Dia, the GTK drawing tool with an 'i'. But, mind you, the 'i' makes all the
difference. It mandates the use of the Internet as a gateway for sharing and
editing the same document in real time.

Currently, this project is only in its proposal stages and we are uncertain as
to what the response of the masses will be. If we do not get enough group members then this project will have to be left to decay. Hopefully that does 
not happen since I believe that this project is really fun and interesting.
Since there is already a website for <a href="http://brain.cs.uiuc.edu:8080/SEcourse/iDia">it</a> I shall refrain from blogging too much
on it.

One of the most exciting thing about this project though is the fact that we
are going to do a GUI for the first time! :)

And unfortunately as of October 1, 12:12 am, I have to dissolve the project because no one signed up for it. I believe we are partly to blame since we did not do a great deal of advertising to the masses. However, I have this lingering suspicion that learning Qt has a lot more to do with it. Most people in this class seem rather misinformed about newer technologies. Besides Microsoft technologies, most of them only know java. The other few who know some other more "intelligent" systems have already set up their groups and attracted the uber-geeks.

So now we are currently in this group: <a href="http://brain.cs.uiuc.edu:8080/SEcourse/Idea+Incubator>Idea-incubator</a>. This project seems to be a merger between <a href="http://dowser.sourceforge.net">Dowser</a> and <a href="http://www.devon-technologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.php">DevonThink </a>uses. And of course, nothing is quite going to beat Spotlight technology on the Mac once it appears in OS X 10.4 Tiger.
