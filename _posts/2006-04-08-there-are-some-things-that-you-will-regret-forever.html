And this is one of them: <a href="http://maczot.com/discuss/?p=44">MysteryZot</a>!. I cannot believed that I paid $15 for it. Those are all DUMB programs. Programs that I do not see myself using or paying for. With $15, I could have bought 3 decent meals. This has been a bad purchase. I seriously would suggest not buying these kinds of software. I don't even know who buys those software. The price might sound cheap to some($9.95 is actually not cheap to me) but I don't see how these kinds of software will be useful in the long run.

Now, this is only my opinion so other people might find them useful. Though I seriously doubt it.</p>
