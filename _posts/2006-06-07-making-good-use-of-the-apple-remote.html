<blockquote cite="http://www.iospirit.com/index.php?mode=view&obj_type=infogroup&obj_id=23" title="Remote Buddy > Overview // IOSPIRIT - fueling creative minds worldwide .."> "The latest Macs ship with a remote control that allows you to control Front Row and a couple of Apple's applications. Beyond that, you can't do much else with it, though. Remote Buddy fundamentally changes this. It gives you control over the rest of your computer via the remote control and also improves the available functionality in those apps that already supported the remote control by themselves"

I am definitely going to install this. Probably might not be the most stable thing application around, but hey, Front Row was really buggy as well even when it first came out. Also, the integration with Photo Booth alone is enough to tempt me to buy it. I have been showing off Photo Booth to my family and friends but it is really annoying to have to click on the mouse when I want to take a picture.

Apple will probably release something else (or they might not) that allows better functionality but for the time being, Remote Buddy is definitely going to help many new Mac owners make use of the Apple Remote.
