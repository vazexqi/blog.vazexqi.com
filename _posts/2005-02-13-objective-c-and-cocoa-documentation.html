title: Objective-C and Cocoa Documentation

<p>
This is a post by a person who might be very ignorant of things. So if you feel that I am wrong please correct me.

Cocoa documentation is pretty bad. It is nothing compared to Java. In fact I believe that it is even worse than C's. And the [ ] is beginning to get to me.

<p>Actually let me rephrase myself. The provided NS libraries are actually very powerful but their syntax is horrible. Someone should really rewrite the entire documentation.
</p>
<p>
I hope I find something that suggests otherwise. I really like interface-builder and I understand most of the advantages of using key-value observing (KVO) and key-value binding (KVB) but the syntax and documentation just gets to me.

Also code completing in Xcode is abysmal. End of story. Another point that I hope Xcode 2.0 will rectify. So far the only promising thing about <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/xcode.html">Xcode 2.0</a> is the Java code completion and the class diagrams. I can't wait to see how it compares to <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a>.
