Joyent really sounds like a fascinating technology. I am going to take a look at it over the summer to see if it is stable enough to use for deployment. I plan to update the grading application for the class that I was a teaching assistant for. While the grading application still works fine, it is not user friendly when the number of students increase. Right now grading can be a pain especially when there are a lot of students.

The ability to actually run it as a desktop application might motivate the moderators to grade their students on time. The interface is going to be the same but I guess the ability to have it function as a desktop application might make it seem more usable.

I have been reading an interesting article called <a href="http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/">Magic Ink: Information Software and Graphical Interface</a> and I am interested in seeing what better user interface I can come up with for the grading application. Maybe it is time to use some of the Ajax stuff that Rails supports.
