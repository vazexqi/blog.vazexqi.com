title: New Powerbook G4?

"[Reports that a 1.67 GHz G4 is about the same speed as a 2.2 GHz Pentium 4 or about as fast as a Pentium M 725 1.6 GHz]"

In other words, even if I were to buy the most powerful configuration for the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook">powerbook</a> (greatest innovation: increased display resolution), it would not be able to compete with what the Pentium M's are capable of. I have had my current powerbook for more than 2 years and its 3 year warranty is going to run out soon. So far, it has perform excellently after 3 OS upgrades: Jaguar, Panther and Tiger. Everything else is working fine too except for the modem which I will not bother replacing. However, its performance is beginning to feel a bit sluggish. After all, it is a 867 Mhz with 512 MB of PC133 RAM. Sometimes when I switch between major applications (i.e. Safari, iTunes, iPhoto) the spinning beach ball comes out. </p>

<p>Even with $3000, I will not be able to get a machine that is on par with the latest Pentium in terms of processor speed. So, the question remains, should I go ahead and get one? Right now, all serious development such as <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/photran">Photran</a> has to be done on my $250 Windows machine. I would really like to be able do more development work on my powerbook.</p>
