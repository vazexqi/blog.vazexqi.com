A few months ago, I blogged about <a href="http://www.flock.com">Flock</a> and how it had a neat idea of integrating a blog editor into the web browser. Amazingly, today I stumbled across Performancing and it does for Firefox 1.5 what Flock is famous for. I could be entirely wrong, but right now it seems that Flock might be in some kind of quagmire. Flock is supposed to be a social browser, one that has heavy reliance of what constitutes web2.0 :flickr, blogging, del.icio.us. With the right extensions, Firefox 1.5 can be configured to do all that and more as well. In fact, Firefox might be a better client for all that since the extensions can easily be updated without requiring the whole application to be redownloaded. So, right now, I am really curious to see what the Flock guys have to say. Of course, I might be totally wrong with this post and Flock might have something completely different up its sleeves.</p>

While I am on the topic of web browsers, I might as well mention that the <a href="http://hmdt-web.net/shiira/en">Shiira Web Browser</a> for OSX is pretty impressive. It uses the same rendering engine as Safari and that&nbsp; makes it really fast. Also, its interface is really nice (much better than any other web browser out there for the OSX: firefox, omniweb, opera). Right now, there is no compelling reason to actually switch over to it unless you are a Safari user in need of a more powerful version of Safari without resorting to plug-ins. By the way, I realize that installing plug-ins for Safari is an almost disastrous move: <a href="http://culater.net/software/PithHelmet/PithHelmet.php">PithHelmet</a> crashes Safari very often, <a href="http://haoli.dnsalias.com/Saft/">Saft</a> makes Safari slow as ever. The only plug-in I have installed right now is just SafariStand and Shiira has most of the features of SafariStand. One really nice thing that I like about Shiira is the fact that it can support bookmarks from different web browsers without actually importing them. Instead of importing, Shirra mirrors them so that you can easily access those bookmarks from Shiira itself. Right now, Shiira supports bookmarks from Safari, Firefox and Opera.

By the way, it seems that right now, Performancing is stil having some trouble with Typo. Originally, I had planned to post this from within Firefox itself but had to resort to the default admin page of Typo after suffering from an error message.
