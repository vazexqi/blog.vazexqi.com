It's been almost two weeks since I started working at Salesforce.com.
And so far I am really enjoying it. There are plenty of interesting and
challenging problems to work on. And we have a good set of internal
tools that we use to get our stuff down.

We work using a variety of different languages with a very large code
base. And, most of the time, the three tools that I have found
indispensable are tmux, vim (or your favorite terminal editor) and zsh
(with the oh-my-zsh plug-ins).

In fact, I would say that these three tools, when adequately configured,
are the most useful things that one can have in their repertoire of
developer tools. They work almost everywhere -- this is very important
when you are not sure which machine you need to be working on locally or
remotely. They are good are what they do -- handling everything from the
simple cases to the more complex ones where loading full fledge GUI
application is just not feasible.

So if you have any time at all, I think it is a good investment to start
learning how to use these tools. The learning curve might be steep at
first but you can always start small and move on from there.
