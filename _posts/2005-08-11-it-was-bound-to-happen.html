<p>(Via <a href="http://www.makezine.com/blog/archive/2005/08/how_to_mac_os_x.html?CMP=OTC-0D6B48984890">HOW TO - Mac OS X Running on Non-Apple Hardware</a>.)</p>

No big deal. After all it is only the developer version. It would be interesting to see how Apple is going to prevent people from cracking OS X 10.5 Leopard though. It would be a real pain to see OS X running on a Dell.
