My temporary foray with Lisp will take a short break. Previously, I had hoped that my Artificial Intelligence class will be utilizing Lisp as the language of choice for its machine problems. Alas, it did not come to be. Instead the class is wallowing in the revolting scent of Java. Well, not that it matters much since I have officially dropped the class after being nettled by the lecturer's use of catechism to teach.</p><p>
So, here are the source files for the lisp code that I have played around with. Most of these are from the chapter exercises in the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0023397632/002-7340374-1235213?v=glance&n=283155&v=glance"><i>Little Lisper</i></a> by Daniel Friedman. This book is no longer in print but you should be able to obtain one from your library.
Here are the files, nicely formatted in html for anyone's perusal:
<ul><li><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/vazexqi/docs/lisp/exercise_3.html">Chapter 3 exercise</a></li><li><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/vazexqi/docs/lisp/exercise_4.html">Chapter 4 exercise</a></li><li><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/vazexqi/docs/lisp/exercise_5.html">Chapter 5 exercise</a></li><li><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/vazexqi/docs/lisp/exercise_6.html">Chapter 6 exercise</a></li><li><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/vazexqi/docs/lisp/exercise_5.html">Chapter 7 exercise</a></li></ul><br />
And here are come code from two chapters which I found particularly interesting:
