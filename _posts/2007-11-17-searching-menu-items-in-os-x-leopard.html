title: Searching Menu Items in OS X Leopard

<p>
A few months ago, I posted an <a href="http://blog.vazexqi.com/articles/2007/07/17/search-your-menu-items">entry</a> about being able to search your menu items and how it can be useful. Well, it seems that OS X Leopard actually has this feature now.

So, by going to the Help menu you can actually search for a phrase and if that phrase appears in the menu items, it highlights it for you. And the blue arrow actually animates by moving slightly.

Of course, this would be more useful with a keyboard shortcut. And the keyboard shortcut that you are looking for is &#x21E7; &#x2318; /. In case those symbols did not show up properly, they're Shift + Command + /.
