title: "2005: An experiment in being productive (with a bit of GTD thrown in)"
---
<p>I have decided to make 2005 the year that I try the most software/ techniques to stay <i>productive</i>. Being productive is a subjective term, so I had better define what it means to me. I just want to ensure that I have all my information where I want it and when I want it. In a nutshell, productivity is efficient information management. Only with efficient information management can I be prepared to take on all the tasks and projects that 2005 holds.
