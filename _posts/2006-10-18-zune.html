<blockquote cite="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/15262121/site/newsweek/page/3/" title="Q&A: Jobs on iPod's Cultural Impact - Newsweek Technology - MSNBC.com"> "In a word, no. I've seen the demonstrations on the Internet about how you can find another person using a Zune and give them a song they can play three times. It takes forever. By the time you've gone through all that, the girl's got up and left! You're much better off to take one of your earbuds out and put it in her ear. Then you're connected with about two feet of headphone cable."

<p>You gotta respect Steve Jobs. With just that one sentence, he has made Zune's main marketing tactic (the ability to share songs wirelessly) sound pathetic. Now anyone who had originally planned to get a Zune will be reminded of this sentence every time they try to send a song to the girl sitting next to them.</p>
