title: Testing trackback in  Typo
---
<p>
I am going to refer to my post at <a href="http://softwareengineering.vazexqi.com/articles/trackback/44">softwareengineering.vazexqi.com</a> and see if Typo successfully sends the trackback to the article.
</p>

Update: This works so I at least know that Typo is not broken. I was just curious to test out its trackback system since there is no field to put the trackback URI. Instead, Typo is supposed to automatically scan the articles that you write for Trackback URI and send a ping to them.
