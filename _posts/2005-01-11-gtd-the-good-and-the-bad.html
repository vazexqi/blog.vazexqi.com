In my previous  <a href="http://dan0597.urh.uiuc.edu/archives/2005/01/2005_an_experim.php">post</a> on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0142000280/ref=nosim/merlinsblog-20/104-4538376-8168725">GTD: Getting Things Done</a>, I mentioned that I will be following up with a more thorough article about how my method of doing things compared to David Allen's. Well, suffice to say, my personal techniques so far are adequate but after being polished by the techniques advocated by David, they have become even more effective. My previous method of getting things share similar traits with David's: reviewing, keeping things all in one place, doing, thinking before doing.
