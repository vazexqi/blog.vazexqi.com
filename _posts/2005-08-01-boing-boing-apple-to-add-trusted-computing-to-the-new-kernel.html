What does this mean? Right now nothing much, but if it turns out to be true, this will probably become a big deal. Rather than speculating what will happen, it is best just to see how things go. I am pretty sure Apple would not be so audacious to piss off all its users just to satisfy Intel or the <i>music industry</i> that is bent on keeping a tight lease on licensing issues. Anyway, even if this were true, I think we could always count on honest developers not to abuse it.

Worse case scenario, fall back to text files, just as what the Pragmatic Programmers suggested in their book: <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/ppbook/index.shtml">From Journeyman to Master</a> and rely on <i>real</i> editors like Vim and Emacs.
