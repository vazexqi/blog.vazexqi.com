<p>
I was planning to get a Ruby t-shirt. So I made the purchase today and bought two: 
<ul><li><a href="http://www.cafepress.com/rubyhappy.23269823">Use Ruby be Happy</a></li><li><a href="http://www.cafepress.com/rails_stuff.25707916">Ruby on Rails</a></li></ul></p><p>
Ironically, what motivated me was <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/07/tshirtfirst_dev.html">this post</a> about Java and people wearing Java t-shirts! No! The Rubyist in me cannot bear to see those guys around totting their Java stuff.
