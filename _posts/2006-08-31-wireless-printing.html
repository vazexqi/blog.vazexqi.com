I decided to get a printer-scanner-copier combo -- something the stores call a multifunction machine. Since Best Buy had an offer on the <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelDetailAct&amp;fcategoryid=116&amp;modelid=13368">Canon Pixma MP160</a> and it costs about $80, I thought that it was a good deal.

And the printer did not disappoint. I installed the drivers and was able to print wirelessly via my Aiport Express. The last time I bought an inkjet printer was almost 5 years ago. I can tell you now that the printing speed has increase dramatically. I printed a 13 page paper that I was supposed to review tonight in less than 5 minutes. I did not pay attention to the total time but it was not much slower than the laser printer in the dorms.

And the copier function is really useful. Not only can I use it without interfacing with the computer but I can also specify how many copies of each that I want. I can definitely save a few trips to the photocopier machines on campus.</p>
