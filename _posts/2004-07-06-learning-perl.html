<p>

Since blosxom relies on perl so much, I figured that it would be beneficial to read up on it. 

Moreover, perl is one of the P-Languages (Perl, Python, PHP, ....) that is good to learn since 

they differ pretty much from the C-Languages. Thus, to help in this endeavor, I have looked upon the 

wisdom of Learning Perl by O'Reilly. I have the book Perl In a Nutshell too in my online collection

but opinions on it are not as supportive. I do not think that Perl is a hard language to learn; it might

be hard to master, though.

<p>

What I hope to accomplish with Perl is to be able to dissect and understand everything about blosxom.cgi;

not that I do not understand it now, but I really want to <i>understand</i> it.
