I am currently reading Donald Norman's book entitled Emotional Design. I read another of his books a couple of weeks back--it was called The Design of Everyday Things. The Design of Everyday Things deals with the behavioral nature of design: function.
However in this book, Norman seems to agree that good design depends also on its beauty and inner appeals.
