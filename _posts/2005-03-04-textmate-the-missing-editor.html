title: Textmate...the *missing* editor?
---
<p>
The latest beta of <a href="http://macromates.com">textmate</a> looks more promising. The fact that they got rid of that stupid evil looking robot icon also makes it more appealing.
</p>
<p>
I am going to test it out for the next 30 days and see how it goes. There seems to be no way to escape seeing it used on the mac for Ruby development.
</p>
<p>
But here are a few things that I do not like about it from glancing at it:
<ul>
<li><i>You have to read the manual to find out how to use it properly.</i>
<br/>
This is not vim but you still have to read the manual to find out how to put it to good use or else you would not be using any of its features.</li>
<li><i>39 euros</i>
<br/>
Hmmm.... that is rather pricey.</li>
<li><i>Weird colors?</i>
<br/>
I really want to change the color scheme asap. But I do not see a fast way to do it so that it associates that color scheme with the file type.
</li>
<li><i>Line numbers</i>
<br/>
I <em>need</em> line numbers on the left margin.</li>
<li><i>The tabs</i>
<br/>
Contrary to macromates claim that the tabs look like real tabs, I still feel that they look disjoint. The tabs do not seem to be attached to the current document.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
I could go on and on but I better stop before I write too much and convince myself that textmate is bad.
