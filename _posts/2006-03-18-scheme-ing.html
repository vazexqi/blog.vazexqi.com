Nice Spring Break reading: <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTLS/">The Little Schemer </a>and <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BTSS/">The Seasoned Schemer</a>. The Little Schemer is just like The Little Lisper with all the exercises removed. I read The Little Lisper last summer and would like to refresh my memory on some Lisp/Scheme since I have not been using it seriously for a while. I think the authors might have revised some of the contents but there was nothing major. Looking forward to getting the third installment of this series, <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/BRS/">The Reasoned Schemer</a>.

What is a nice environment for trying out scheme on OS X? There are a couple of implementations as listed <a href="http://schemers.org/Implementations/#environments">here</a>. <a href="http://www.drscheme.org/">DrScheme</a> is the only one so far that runs on OS X with a nice little IDE and some help files. The only other one that seems viable is <a href="http://schemeway.sourceforge.net/schemescript.html">SchemeWay</a> but hooks itself up as a plug-in for Eclipse. And I really do not feel like starting up Eclipse every time I want to try something.

An interesting feature that DrScheme offers  -- among the other innovative features that I will not be using yet -- is the ability to embed test cases inside the code. While this might seem like a trivial thing, DrScheme has a nice facility for doing so as can be seen from the screenshot below.
