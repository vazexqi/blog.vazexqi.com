title: RailsAppHosting deal

<p><a href="http://forum.railsapphosting.com/topic/show/26">RailsAppHosting Forum - Message to all beta testers</a>: 
<blockquote>
"Upon launching we will be offering a once-off 'lifetime hosting' deal for US$100. We will also be accepting two payments of US$50 over two months to make it even more affordable (yes, TextDrive gets the credit for this idea originally). This will allow us to raise some capital for infrastructure and it's a bit of a reward for our beta testers."
</blockquote><blockquote>
500MB disk space per application, 3GB bandwidth per app (the sum of all 
traffic in plus all traffic out) per month. So between the three apps a 
lifetime account will receive 1.5GB space, 9GB bandwidth per month.

Sounds like a good deal to me so I am going to continue hosting this web blog on <a href="http://blog.railsapphosting.com/">railsappshosting.com</a>.
