This was one of my Java projects that I created last semester for the Programming Studios class. This is not really one that I was very proud of because it has some bugs that I could not fix. Mostly because we were using the <a href="http://www.javazoom.net/javalayer/javalayer.html">JLayer</a> libraries and the documentation is not really accurate. The bug was that it was not possible to asynchronously fast-forward, rewind or switch to the next song. Also, the library itself is not multi-threaded so I had to create a separte thread to enable GUI interactions.

To compensate for those shortcomings, I implemented an ID3-v1 editor. Also, I made it read and create .m3u play lists. Something which I was particularly happy with is the ability to select the genre via a combo box in the table. That required some time to figure out.

Also, this post was made from within flickr itself,so it serves as a test post to see how good flickr's <i>blog this photo</i> service is. And as of this moment, it has failed miserably. So here I am back in <a href="http://ranchero.com/marsedit/">Marsedit</a> editing this.
