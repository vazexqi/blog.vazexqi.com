Google keeps coming up with all these cool ideas! Now they have <a href="http://print.google.com">Google Print</a>. It allows you to search for text inside PRINTED books. That is right, printed books! Those kind that you cannot read of a web page.

It is even faster than bringing that book out from your shelf, looking through the table of contents and the index to find what you need. Just go to Google Print and if you are lucky, they have already archived that book.

Being the smart people that they are, Google has of course not provided an easy way to browse through all the pages from beginning to end. Instead you get to only view pages that match your search criteria. But, bare in mind, this gives you the best of both worlds! You can read your book in its printed format, and then search through it using Google!

Excellent! Especially for books that do not have electronic versions.
