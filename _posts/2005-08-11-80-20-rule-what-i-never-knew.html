Some things that I found interesting:
<ul>
<li>It's known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto">Pareto</a> Principle!</li>
<li>But, it was first proposed by Joseph M. Juran, so it should be called Juran's Assumption!</li>
<li>It is a cause and effect statement; so using it like such: "20% of individuals in an organization perform 80% of the work" is not a valid statement since it is not known that the individuals <i>contribute</i>to the progress of work.</li>
</ul>
