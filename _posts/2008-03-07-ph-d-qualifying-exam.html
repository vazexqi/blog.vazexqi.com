title: PhD Qualifying Exam
---
<p>
So every student doing a PhD at UIUC (and I think any US university) is expected to pass a qualifying exam. The <a href="https://agora.cs.uiuc.edu/display/cs428sp08/2008/02/29/Reading+for+the+Midterm">qualifying exam</a> gauges whether a student is competent enough to continue in the PhD program. However, it's much more than that. I think it's more of a test to see how well you can do a presentation and answer tough questions during the presentation; as well as trying to not sound stupid in front of a very smart audience.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, I took my exam two weeks ago. It was an oral presentation where I was assigned two papers:
<a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1297105.1297029">The jastadd Extensible Java Compiler</a> and <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/pag/pubs/test-factoring-ase2005-abstract.html">Automatic Test Factoring</a>. Both papers were about tools (something that I interested in as I mentioned in my research statement to the exam committee).
</p>

<p>
It's interesting to note how the two papers are somehow connected with me. I first saw the JastAdd system while I was at OOPSLA '07. I had even talked to the authors of the paper, attended their poster session and even their demo session. Fortunately (or unfortunately) I did not attend their presentation session so my presentation was not influenced by theirs. I was already interested in studying this paper in-depth because of the system. And having it chosen as my qualifying exam paper gave me even more motivation.
</p>

<p>
The second paper was interesting because, Danny, one of my colleagues from the same research group is now working under <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/mernst/research/students.html">Prof. Michael Ernst</a>. Danny had referenced some of Ernst's work before. So I was familiar with some of the terminology in the paper and was able to use that to my advantage.
</p>

<p>It's just interesting to see what a small world it is....</p>

<p>
My slides for the presentations are available here: <a href="/files/JastAdd.pdf">JastAdd.pdf</a> and <a href="/files/AutoFactoring.pdf">AutoFactoring.pdf</a>. I am not sure how interesting they would be on their own but they are <em>pretty</em> to look at.
</p>

<p>
<strong>And I just found out that I passed!</strong> The committee had this to say:
</p>

<blockquote>
"The committee were impressed with his performance and background knowledge".
</blockquote>

<p>
So that's one crucial step toward completing my Ph.D! :)
