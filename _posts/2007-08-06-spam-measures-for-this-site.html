title: Spam measures for this site
---
<p>
Seems like I was hit by some comment spammers this afternoon which cause this site to be down.
</p>

<p>
As as a precaution, I have disabled trackbacks site wide and also limit comments so that they can only be entered via the web interface (meaning that you need to use the Ajax interface). This should not be a problem since I get very little feedback anyway and I definitely do not want the site to go down again because of spam.

I do have <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a> protection but it did not seem to protect against the kinds of spam that were hitting me.
