Together with its previous acquisition of <a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a>, Yahoo seems to be trying to get into the whole hip web-savvy user tools thing. After all, <i>all</i> hip bloggers use flickr for photos and <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> for their bookmarks. And don't forget those tags. Hmmm... maybe they are going to go buy up <a href="http://www.43things.com">43things.com</a> soon.</p>

<p>Either Yahoo wants to jump in and get some of the share from this set of hip users, or they just really ran out of ideas of their own and are cashing in on what other people are doing. Not a bad call  based on previous opinions on this matter by <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/how_do_you_feel_about_someone_else_making_money_off_your_content.php">Joe</a> and <a href="http://www.dashes.com/anil/2005/10/25/the_interesting">Anil</a>.</p>
