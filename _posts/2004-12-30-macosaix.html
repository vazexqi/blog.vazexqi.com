<p>This is a program that can automatically create a tiled mosaic of your picture using other pictures from google image or by generating font images from your font collection. It then assembles them so that they resemble your original image. The more tiles that you specify the better the results, and also the more processing time it will take. Take a look at some of the examples: <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/knarf/MacOSaiX/Examples/">MacOSaiX - Examples</a></p>
