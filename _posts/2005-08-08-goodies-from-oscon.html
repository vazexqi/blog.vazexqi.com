<p>
In case you have not noticed, there is a whole plethora of resources for the presentations that were made during OSCON 2005. Here is the <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/38/presentations.html">link</a> to get your hands on those resources.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, the best stuff might not be on that page. Why the lucky stiff has been kind enough to provide some links to other presentations <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/cult/osconGoodsFromMatzWeirich.html">here</a>. Of course, he has been too modest and conveniently forget to include his own wonderful presentations. So, to grab why's unorthodox presentations, which befitting that term, head over to <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/cult/aVideoButLaterMoreWhen.html">redhanded</a> and enjoy some truly hilarious fun with his videos.

My personal recommendations as of today are:
<ul><li><a href="http://www.onestepback.org/articles/10things/index.html">10 Things Every Programmer Should Know About Ruby</a></li><small>I cannot believe that Weirich actually mentions the Sapir-Whorf theory! Shows that what you learn in Anthropology does come in useful sometimes.</small><li><i>All</i> of <a href="http://www.whytheluckystiff.net/starry/">Why's Stary Afternoon Torrents</a></li><li><a href="http://www.vanderburg.org/Speaking/Stuff/oscon05.pdf">Metaprogramming Ruby</a></li></ul></p><p>
As mentioned in my previous <a href="/articles/2005/08/05/foscon-some-people-have-all-the-fun">post</a>, I cannot wait to see what why did with drb. He might really be onto something here: a new, more fun way to teach programming in a new and more fun language. A language that is not designed to appease corporate managers, but one to get hackers together.

In case anyone is wondering, I am posting these links not because there is a dearth of web blogs writing about how awesome OSCON was, but because I really think these presentations are interesting. And I would really loved to be there too.
