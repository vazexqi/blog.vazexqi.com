What happened to FrontPage?
<br />
After nine years of being an award-winning [this is BS; if it is that good why would you discontinue it?] Web authoring tool, FrontPage will be discontinued in late 2006. We will continue to serve the diverse needs of our existing FrontPage customers with the introduction of these three brand-new application building and Web authoring tools using the latest technologies, Microsoft&reg; Office SharePoint&reg; Designer 2007 for the enterprise information workers, Microsoft&reg; Expression&trade; Web Designer for the professional Web designer and Microsoft&reg; Visual Studio 2005 for the Web developer."

I do not usually blog about such things but I find that this is not a sad event but a rather joyful one. I really hate Front Page. I touched it once when it came out in Office 2000. And once again in Office 2003. Both times, it has annoyed me to no end. I cannot put my finger on it. Its interface is really bad for coding. And it does not have a good set of templates. Also, I think it tries to include weird tags that only Microsoft products can use. Eventually I just decided to use <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/">Dreamweaver</a> (although I feel that the latest version is a bit too bloated for its own good as well) and just coding some web pages using raw HTML.

<p>I am not the only one who thinks that Front Page should just go down the drain. Check out what the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=180403#180403">Channel 9</a> guys have to say. Also, see what <a href="http://digg.com/software/FrontPage_2003_is_dead">Digg.com</a> has to offer.</p>

Another product that has been a constant annoyance to me is <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/FX010857981033.aspx">Visio</a>. However, that is just probably my opinion since all I need is something simple like <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/">OmniGraffle</a>.
