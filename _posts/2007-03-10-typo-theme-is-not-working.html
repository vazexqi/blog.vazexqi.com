title: Typo theme is not working
---
<p>
The theme for Typo is not working correctly. I am not sure what is wrong. I have tried selecting different themes (even trying the defaults ones: Azure and Scribbish) but to no avail. I have even tried reinstalling Typo but that does not work also. I am using Typo 4.03 and I am not using the unstable versions from Typo trunk so I am really not sure what is going on. It just stopped working one day. I don't think the upgrade to Rails 1.2 broke anything since my other blog at softwarengineering.vazexqi.com is still working fine.
