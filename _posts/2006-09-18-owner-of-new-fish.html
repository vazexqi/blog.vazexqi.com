title: Owner of new fish

<p>
In an series of unlikely events, I am now the owner of 3 fish: two guppies and a algae eater and 2 water frogs. All 5 puny animals reside on a hexagon aquarium in the middle of the sitting room.

What's really funny is that the "fish lady" at PetSmart strongly prohibited my girl friend from buying any fish larger than a quarter. She claims that the aquarium is much too small for anything larger than that. And 5 is like the upper limit on the number of aquatic creatures for that aquarium.
