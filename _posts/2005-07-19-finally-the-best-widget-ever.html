title: Finally.. the BEST widget ever!

<img alt="BackPack Widget by Chipt" src="http://www.chipt.com/widget/widget_animated.gif" /><p>
Finally, at this very moment I have found the greatest and best widget of all times!
And it is the <a href="http://www.chipt.com/widget.html">Backpack widget</a> by Chipt Productions, LLC. Words cannot describe how useful it is. The quicksilver Backpack plug-in is neat but this is really excellent. And it is all because 37Signals, the creators of Backpack has the brains to expose the BackPack API to developers.

I believe that Chipt is a start-up company. Well, if this is what they are capable of offering, then I cannot wait for what else they have in store for their customers.

Of course, need I add, all this is possible through the clever use of Ruby on Rails.
