title: On Trusted Platform Module and Apple

<p>
I do not know enough to say anything intelligent, nor would I say anything to speculate on something that clearly is beyond my control. Therefore, I am grateful that John Gruber has produced such <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2005/08/trusted">a fantastic piece</a> discussing this issue that was sparked from two separate articles from <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/07/31/apple_to_add_trusted.html">Cory Doctorow</a> and <a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/08/01/0421248">Slashdot</a>.

Here is what I think: 
<ul>
<li>Apple would not do something stupid to jeopardize itself right after hitting the sweet spot with so many developers.</li>
<li>I doubt that Apple or Intel or whatever can force developers to write programs that will utilize this <i>evil</i> technology</li>
<li>Even if there were, there will be definitely some where to <b>crack</b> it.</li>
<li>Why fret over something that you know nothing about? Apple has not even released Leopard yet!</li>
</ul>
