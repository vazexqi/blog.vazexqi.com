<blockquote cite="http://rubymanual.org/module/Kernel/y" title="Ruby Manual Kernel-y"> "ryan:	You know how Kernel.p is a really convenient way to dump ruby structures? The only downside is that it's not as legible as YAML.
<br />
_why:	(listening)
<br />
ryan:	I know you don't want to urinate all over your users' namespaces. But, on the other hand, convenience of dumping for debugging is, IMO, a big YAML use case.
<br />
_why:	Go nuts! Have a pony parade!
<br />
ryan:	Either way, I certainly will have a pony parade."

I just found this out while browsing the methods in module Kernel in Ruby. In my opinion, this is not even funny. In fact, it is a very inconsiderate thing to do in terms of documentation.
