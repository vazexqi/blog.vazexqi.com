title: MacBook Pro is finally here

<p>
Fast. Really fast. Especially since I was coming from a 867 MHz G4.
</p>

<p>
Instead of stating the obvious things that other people have already stated, let me point out some differences between this Mac and my old powerbook.
</p>

<p>
<i>Good</i> things first.
<ul>
<li>The keyboard feels much nicer to type on. It has this nice tactile feel to it. The keys just seem to bounce nicely.</li>
<li>The ambient sensor keyboard is the coolest thing around!</li>
<li>The screen is much brighter compared to my powerbook or even my 20.1 inch Dell Monitor.</li>
<li>The bigger track pad really works well. I feel like I have better control over the mouse.</li>
<li>Having the ports on the sides is actually pretty convenient. I don't have to bent over now to hook up my monitor. But since these ports are exposed, I wonder if they will gather dust fairly quickly.</li>
<li>The remote control for front row is really nice. I wonder what happens when the battery runs out though.</li>
<li>Having an iSight camera built-in is actually pretty useful.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<i>Not</i> so good things now.
<ul>
<li>The speakers sound a bit different - not in a <i>better</i> way. It is definitely louder but the sound seems a bit scratchy as well. The chime that the Mac makes whne it boots up sounds slightly different. But fortunately both left and right speakers are working.</li>
<li>I <i>hate</i> the slot loading CD/DVD drive. Yeah, it's cool but I always feel like it is going to die soon. When I inserted the provided DVD to install, the mechanical sounds it produces is enough to scare most people off.</li>
<li>The MacBook Pro feels rather warm to touch. I am not even running at highest performance but the keyboard area feels warm already. However the fan has not kicked in so that is fine since there isn't that annoying fan noise.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
And now, it's back to installing software. I prefer to do this by hand instead of using the Migration Assistant because I feel like keeping my system clean and I really do want to keep track of which applications are universal binaries.</p>
