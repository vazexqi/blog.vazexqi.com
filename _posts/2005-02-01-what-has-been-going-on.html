title: What has been going on?

<p>
It has been about 2 weeks since I wrote anything in here. Quite a lot has happened. And I thought I might as well record some of them here for my own future references.

<i>My network was disabled</i>
<br/>
Someone discovered that mySQL was running on this computer; no surprise since MovableType does indeed rely on mySQL. Anyway, the housing network admin shut it off on a Friday evening meaning that there was no one who I could call to rectify the situation.
<br/>
I was "lucky" however to have a technician call me on Saturday afternoon. He was telling me about securing mySQL and closing the port. And about modifying some lines in the my.cnf file. So, I asked him where is the my.cnf file stored on OS X? He said he would check it out for me. 10 minutes passed and he still could not find it. So he promised to call me back. And never did. So my network connection was not restored on Saturday. 2 days without the Internet made me "antsy" (a term my girl friend used to describe me).
<br/>
Come Sunday, there was at least some help line that I could call. I was fearing for the worst since this is a mySQL problem and not some normal Windows problem (Windows solution: remove spyware/ download updates/ run antivirus /etc). Fortunately, someone with the mental capabilities that surpassed that of a hamster (I like making allusions to a hamster's mental capabilities) picked up the phone. He trusted that I had fix the problem and thus enabled my connection once again. An occasion that called for at least some celebration. But that is for another blog entry.
<br/>
Come to think of it, I am still not sure how the problem affects me directly. But it did give me a chance to find out more about mySQL and how to secure it more. <i>Not that it was any less secure before this.</i>

<i>Vi: Not so bad after all</i>
<br/>
I played with Vi yesterday. I have no idea why. But then I decided that I have finally come to terms with its modes. And after dabbling for the past 6 hours on it, I can say that I am impressed. The commands that are useful are the %,$,* keys. Try them. Vi offers something like what Eclipse has to offer without all the blot. And it runs on all machines. Well all the machines that I come in contact with anyway.
<br/>
I proceeded to download the mac version of Gvim just so that I can have mouse support. And I think that I will be using it more for my coding needs now; more that BBEdit. But I think I will still be using BBEdit for .html edits just because it has an excellent sftp plug-in.

<i>CS418: Computer graphics</i>
<br/>
I have been spending the last 3 hours trying to fix the installation of libgfx! And this is only the installation. Nothing more! It seems that there is potentially a problem with libpng 1.2.7 that could cause a crash, as the official description says: "Versions 1.2.7, 1.2.6, 1.0.17, and 1.0.16 have a bug that will cause  applications that strip the alpha channel (while reading a PNG) to crash.  The bug is fixed in versions 1.2.8 and 1.0.18, which were  released on 3&#160;December." Fink did not have the latest version so I had to compile it. Fortunately, there were binaries available from <a href="http://www.hmug.org/">HMUG: The Huntsville Mac User Group</a>.
<br/>
Anyway, now that that is over, I have some links that are useful for those who might be interested in the same problems:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.indyjt.com/tutorial/cs318/">Someone who took this class before (has info on how to use FINK, Xcode)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://graphics.cs.uiuc.edu/~garland/software/libgfx.html">libgfx homepage</a></li>
<li><a href="http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=752">OpenGL C syntax highlighting for Vim</a></li>
</ul>
<br/>
Also, please read my <a href="http://dan0597.urh.uiuc.edu/archives/2005/01/fltk_to_work_on.php">entry</a> on getting FLTK to work.
</p>
<p>
Also I guess that this might just be some small addition but I am playing around with Subversion as well now. It seems to make more sense to use some form of revision control for MPs that are going to be at least 200 lines of code.
<br/>
Here are two excellent links:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://maczealots.com/tutorials/xcode-svn/">Subversion with Xcode</a></li>
<li><a href="http://maczealots.com/tutorials/xcode-svn/">MacDevCenter.com: Making the Jump to Subversion</a></li>
</ul>

This entry is obviously something that I just quickly throw together. So forgive the organization.
