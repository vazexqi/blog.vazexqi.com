title: Ranchero Software has gotten it right!

<p>
Ranchero software has gotten the little <b>+</b> button on the top left corner of every window right. In NetNewsWire and MarsEdit, the button MAXIMIZES the current window to the full size of the screen. And another click restores it to the original position. Excellent!
