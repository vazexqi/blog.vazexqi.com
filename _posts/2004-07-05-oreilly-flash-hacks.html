title: O'Reilly Flash Hacks
---
<p>

This proves to be an interesting book to show all the tricks, or as O'Reilly calls it: hacks, that

can be accomplished in Flash. The level of actionscript is not too advanced and the scripts themselves 

are relatively short which makes them even better hacks; things which normal people will

never have thought of. Chapter 1 was interesting enough to pique my appetite.

Will showcase some of the flash tricks that I have modified soon. Really soon.
