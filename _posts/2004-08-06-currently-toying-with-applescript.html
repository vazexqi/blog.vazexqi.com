title: Currently toying with Applescript
---
<p>
I am trying to learn some Applescript in preparation for the Automator feature in Tiger. Though the sneak preview of it shows that a user need not know how to code in Applescript, it would not doubt be more beneficial to have that ability. The most bothersome thing about Applescript is the fact that it is not succinct. It has that very verbal tone to it that makes me have to type more than I appreciate. Its documentation is not too appealing for me either since it does not document clearly what class it returns and how to access it. I was trying to find out how to use Applescript Studio to design a simple GUI controller for iTunes following this <a href="http://cocoadevcentral.com/articles/000073.php"> tutorial</a>. I wanted to make the artwork for iTunes appear on an NSImageView place holder but that turned out to be a nightmare to implement especially while I am half asleep in the middle of the night. I definitely want to try to get this working. And also make the window that displays that artwork slightly transparent. As a side note, I found that there is generally a dearth of good resources for some more obscure Mac features on the net. Sure you can find a plethora of information for things that almost everyone understands but when you want to find something that is slightly more cryptic, your best chance would be to pour through the documentation yourself. Apple's documentation that were written for OS 10.1 and still not updated are one of the more cryptic things that I have read.
