title: ECE 249 final project

<p>
I will be making a simple pong sharing the same concepts as the one found in the ipod except that my version will be even simpler. Why make such a stupid thing for a final project? Well, the main reason being that we are using VHDL to synthesize this so that it can work on the hardware level. Writing something in VHDL and having its simulation running does not mean that it is hardware-implementable. And that is a situation I do not wish to encounter after writing 1000 lines of VHDL code. The second reason being that I am more concern with having a working project. And lastly, I might add that I have little faith for my lab partner who has not contributed anything useful to all of our experiments.

I will be making a separate page that is to be hosted on my .mac homepage so that it is public accessible. I will put my source code and the report online. Hopefully someone finds it useful.

Here is the .mac page for it: <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/vazexqi/ece249">ECE249</a>
