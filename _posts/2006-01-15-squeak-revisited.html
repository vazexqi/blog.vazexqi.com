title: Squeak Revisited
---
<p>
Using <a href="http://www.squeak.org/">Squeak</a> is imminent. So I might as well make the most of it. At first, the experience was horrendous. The syntax of SmallTalk itself is fine since I know both Objective-C and Ruby, both languages that derive themselves heavily from SmallTalk. The problem lies with Squeak itself. I found it almost impossible to control intuitively (read: meaning without reading some manual) on my PowerBook. After all, there is only <b>ONE</b> mouse button on my notebook!</p>

<p>
I used <a href="http://smalltalk.cincom.com/downloads/index.ssp?content=visualworks">Cincom VisualWorks</a> before and it did not trouble me as much since there was some good introduction available. Not to mention the presence of toolbars so I did not need to bring up the contextual menu. But Squeak seems to have more plug-ins and multimedia stuff available. Also, Squeak will be used for the class that I am taking. 
</p>

<p>So to the rescue, are two very nicely written short articles.
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.mucow.com/squeak-qref.html">Squeak Smalltalk: Basic Language Reference</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.duke.edu/~bmp5/squeak/usable.html">Squeak Tutorials: Making Squeak Productive</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
By the way, the guy who wrote the second tutorial comes from Duke and was an intern at Fog Creek Software, which another of my favorite tech writers, <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a>, owns.</p>

<p>
So if 2005 was the year that I learned LISP (and did not use it much in the end thanks to the fact that my A.I. class adopted Java!), 2006 will be the year that I learn SmallTalk. So far, what I really like about Smalltalk is how terse the language itself is. Also, I like the dynamic nature of the environment since any changes that are made, including installing new plug-ins, are immediately effective.</p>

<p>
Still the potential for screwing the entire image is there since I am still not too familiar with how Squeak maintains different instances of itself. Different instances as in .image files and not a different project or workspace.</p>
