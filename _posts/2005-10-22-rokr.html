                Bloomberg.com:
            Top Worldwide</a>: 
<blockquote>
"Motorola Inc.'s iTunes music phone,
developed with Apple Computer Inc. and unveiled last month in
front of an audience of more than 500, may have flopped."

<p>Do they seriously want people to call it the <i>Rocker</i>? Somehow, I felt that Apple was not putting everything into this product. Instead it was more of a brainchild of Motorola. No Apple logo on the phone <i>at all</i> only the weak association with iTunes. Moreover, the spotlight of the release event was given to the iPod Nano which seems to radiate more techo lust than a Motorola phone. And given all the hype that surrounded it for almost a year (the taoofmac web site even has a <a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space/iPhone">timeline</a> for it), it is inevitable that everyone would be expecting a little more. For a discussion of why hype is bad, John Gruber has produced an excellent analysis of the situation at <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2005/01/the_rumor_game">daringfireball.net</a> It was as though Apple did not even cared about the leakage of the Rokr even when EnGadget had a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/entry/1234000887049175/">photo</a> of the actual product months ahead.</p>

<p>I don't own one, and I do not plan to own one. So all I can say: I am glad I did not get one. Listening to your music on your phone still seems like a very <i>dumb</i> idea especially when you are stuck with one carrier. And a phone that does not really sync properly with iTunes. Calling it the iTunes phone is a great misnomer. </p>
