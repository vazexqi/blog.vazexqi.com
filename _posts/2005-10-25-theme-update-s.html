title: Theme update(s)

<p>
There is a new theme competition going on at <a href="http://typogarden.com/">Typo Garden</a> for Typo. One particular theme caught my fancy: Concomitant by <a href="http://marsorange.com/archives/typo-theme-concomitant">Mars Hall</a>. Before the themes (there are set of 4, which can be accessed using the colored buttons on the top left corner) can be used, I had to add a black border around the images because most of my images have a white background; a white background on gray really looks very out of place.

Right now I am very satisfied with the theme. The only drawback is that live search is no longer "live" but causes the search page to be returned. Well, that is not that  bad. After all, one seldom need to search, right?
