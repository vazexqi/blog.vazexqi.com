I have tried using <a href=http://www.A9.com>A9.com</a> in the past but because it was not integrated into Safari's search toolbar, I found it more convenient to use its default google search engine instead.
</p>
<p>
However, after downloading <a href="http://www.atamadison.com/w/kitzkikz.php?page=Sogudi">Sogudi</a> and adding a default_search shortcut into its preferences, I was able to change the default search engine for Safari's toolbar to A9.com. Just create a field called default_search and set its attributes to http://www.a9.com/@@@.

The advantages you gain by using A9.com when you have an account are having your search history available to you and also the list of sites that you have accessed through A9.com. This can be useful if you are browsing from another computer and you want to recall what topic you searched for and what pages you visited.
</p>
<p>
A tip to speed up searching would be to turn of images, references, etc on A9.com.

If you prefer to be able to log and index everything that you have searched for on your local computer, then you might want to try <a href="http://dowser.sourceforge.net/">Dowser</a>.

Firefox users have the choice of using the A9.com toolbar or just installing a search plug-in. The A9.com toolbar seems to have more features including bookmarks and a diary.
