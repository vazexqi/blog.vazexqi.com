<p><a href="http://developer.apple.com/tools/rubyonrails.html">Using Ruby on Rails for Web Development on Mac OS X</a>: "This article introduces you to Ruby on Rails by building a trivial web application step by step.  Consider it a ride on the express train -- an overview of what Rails can do, including a look at features new to Rails 1.0.  In the end you'll be better equipped to consider the advantages of powering your web application with Rails."</p>
