By the way, the picture above shows my latest project. 42things.com an emulation of 43things.com. All done in Ruby on Rails goodness. Ruby is becoming my favorite language.

The actual coding took less than a week. But if you count in total numbers of hours actually spent coding, it is about 24 hours. Most of the time, we were tweaking the database schema so that it is more normalized.

Some features supported:
<ul>
<li>Searching</li>
<li>User accounts</li>
<li>Comments</li>
<li>Entries for items the user is doing</li>
<li>Related tags</li>
<li>Related items</li>
</ul>
