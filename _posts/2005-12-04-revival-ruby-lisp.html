"First, I'm sure you've read a lot of the <a href="http://del.icio.us/tag/ruby+lisp">ruby-lisp equivalence</a> discussions over the weekend.  This is great stuff, I hope it gets deeper and we can find some good middleground.  The way I feel about Lisp is the way I feel about socialism.  Neat ideals and I really wish they worked on humans!"

I will definitely want to read at least two of the pages bookmarked on the link above. This is definitely an interesting revival of my interest in ruby+lisp -- not that it ever <i>died</i> or anything but it must have diminished during the past few months as I ventured into other stuff. Heck, if this ruby+lisp thing is interesting enough, I might even be able to write a thesis on it.</p>

<p>Errr... so why the post? Nothing much yet, just reserving a place for it here so that I do remember to come back and write about it.</p>
