title: How programming languages are created...

<p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/fix.html">What Languages Fix</a>: 
<blockquote>
"Cobol: Fortran is scary."
<br />
"Basic: Fortran is scary."
<br />
"APL: Fortran isn't good enough at manipulating arrays."
</blockquote></p>

<p>Seems like most of the other languages created that try to make Fortran less scary are not too successful nowadays. Well Visual Basic is still OK, but it isn't really the Basic language that it was. </p>

<p>The entire list of programming languages and what they try to fix is available from the link above. Kelleher really presents an interesting view to why programming languages were created. In fact, I think, if it were not because assembly language is so cryptic for most people, we would not even end up with C...C++...Java....C#....(what other C variant language?)</p>
