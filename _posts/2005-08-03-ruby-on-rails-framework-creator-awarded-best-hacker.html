title: Ruby on Rails framework creator awarded Best Hacker!
---
<p><a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000489.html">Winning Google/O'Reilly's Best Hacker of '05 (Loud Thinking)</a>: "The ego inflation just culminated in a near pop. The Google-O'Reilly Open Source Awards granted me the great honor of being named "Best Hacker" of the year for the work with Ruby on Rails"</p><p>
Well deserved award! When you see companies such as Google and O'Reilly giving out awards, you know that those awards are not some stupid corporate pieces of bullcrap. This is one real achievement, both for David and also the Ruby on Rails community. There is definitely some essence to all the hype about Ruby and Rails.

Hopefully the next time around, <a href="http://versions.tech.coop/lisp-on-lines/doc/lisp-on-lines.txt">Lips on Lines</a> wins the award. <i>One can dream cant't he?</i></p>
