This is a new way of thinking of ubiquitous computing. The author, Chris thinks that we do have enough devices to accomplish ubiquitous computing. We have all our cellphones, iPods, PDAs, etc. For a person such as myself who is living within the campus, finding computers is even easier: just go into any building and log in with your student account. But, even with all the computing power in the world right now, there is a lack of coherence. It is almost impossible to get a PC to sync with my powerbook. Sure .Mac synchronization means that I have access to all my bookmarks, contacts and schedule. But that is about there is to it. What if I need to access other things? What if I need some file to do some presentation? Am I able to access all my notes? The chances of ever needing those files are not too probable, but they are real. And when you really need those files what can you do to get them?
