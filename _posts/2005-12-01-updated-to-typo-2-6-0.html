Finally updated to Typo 2.6.0 and hopefully I have fixed the .fcgi problem where the page refuses to load. Everything looks fine so far, except the format of the new database.yml file was rather interesting when I first glanced at it. Nonetheless, rake migrate went well and there does not seem to be any problems.

Anyway, I feel more assured if this test post gets through.</p>
