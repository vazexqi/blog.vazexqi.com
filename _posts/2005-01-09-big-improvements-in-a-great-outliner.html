title: Big Improvements in a Great Outliner

<p><a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/6174">Big Improvements in a Great Outliner</a>: "I do wish that the new utility drawer would open on whatever side of the window has room as Mail's does. Currently it's a minor annoyance to have it always open on the left &#8211; at least it moves the window for you. The one real problem I encountered was a regression from the previous version &#8211; 3.0 took around 75 times as long to open the same OPML file as 2.2.6 did. Assuming that is fixed, OmniOutliner 3 is an improvement in every way"</p>

I have to say something about this. I seriously <b>do not</b> like the way the utility drawer opens in Apple Mail. Nor do I like the way it does it in BBEdit. The utility drawer should stay on one side of the window--the side that you decided upon! It is <b>annoying</b> when the utility drawer decides to pop up on the other side that you are not used to. I am glad that OmniOutliner does this right just as OmniWeb does it right. Just my 2 cents!

On another side of things: one slight bug that I discover in OmniOutliner Pro is the fact that if you assign your named styles quick keys using CTRL, it does not seem to work. But if you stick with the function keys, it works. I have no idea why. But I have left it to the function keys. Dragging and dropping that small icon to the text that you want to stylize does not seem very efficient to me.
