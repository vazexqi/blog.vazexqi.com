<p>
I should really spend more time learning Ruby and Rails. I am really hooked by the claims that people are making. Here are two newly discovered resources:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.slash7.com/">slash7.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://rails.homelinux.org/">rails.homelinux.org</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
It does seem that I am easily swayed toward some new technology depending on how passionate its users are talking/ blogging about it.
