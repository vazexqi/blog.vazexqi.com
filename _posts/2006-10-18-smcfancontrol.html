<a href="http://www.conscius.de/~eidac/software/page5/page5.html">smcFanControl</a> is a useful little app that enables you to change the fan speeds on your MacBook (Pro). But just setting the speed on both fans to 3000 rpm, the internal temperature of my MacBook Pro dropped by 20 Celcius. Now it is comfortable enough to touch. There spinning fans are barely audible.

As usual with tweaks such as this, you should be aware of how it might affect your computer. I don't see any real harm in speeding the fans up, but it might shorten their life-span in the future. On the other hand, you also begin to wonder how much damage might come about from having a computer that is constantly pushing the internal temperature close to 70 Celsius. So there is a tradeoff there. Personally, I think the fans can do a better job of withstanding the increase spinning compared to the long term effect of extreme heat on the machine.
