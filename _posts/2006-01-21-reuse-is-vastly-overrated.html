title: Reuse is vastly overrated

<blockquote>
"Context beats consistency. Reuse only works well when the particular instances are so similar that you're willing to trade the small differences for the increased productivity. That's often the case for infrastructure, such as Rails, but rarely the case for business logic, such as authentication and modules and components in general."

This is kind of interesting since David actually mentioned this somewhere along in the <a href="http://snakesandrubies.com/event/">Snakes and Rubies</a> event <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/articles/2006/01/06/snakes-and-rubies-video-now-available">video</a>.

So unless you are creating a library/framework I suspect that there is really no need to make your classes/function general enough that you are going to be able to use in the not-so distant future when you really do not even know what to expect.</p>
