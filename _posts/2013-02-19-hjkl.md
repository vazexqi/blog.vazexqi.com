Over the past year, I've been working hard to indoctrinate my fingers to
become better citizens of HJKL-land. To be a good citizen of HJKL-land,
one must train in the way of Vim: resist all urges to move the hands to
the arrows keys or to the mouse; strive to keep your fingers on the home
row; think in terms of text motions instead of simple keyboard motions;
and, of course, endeavor to remove all wasted motion in one's daily text
editing. 

Being a citizen of HJKL-land is indeed a rewarding experience.

But it wasn't easy. Sure, one could make progress by reading a
[book](http://pragprog.com/book/dnvim/practical-vim) watching some
[screencasts](http://vimcasts.org/), installing a couple of
[plug-ins](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus) and even reading about
[Vimscript](http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/). But just
using Vim occasionally isn't going to help indoctrinate you to be a good
citizen. Until one starts using Vim for the essentials, it just isn't
going to click.

For a developer, this means being in Vim-mode for the tools you use
daily: your shell, your terminal, your web browser (don't laugh, just
time how much time you spend in your web browser reading Stackoverflow
each day) and your _other_ IDEs (for when you can't use Vim).

There are many excellent tutorials out there about Vim. This isn't one of
them. Instead, the point of this post is to illustrate how to get some of the
tools that you use daily into Vim-mode. Spending as much time in Vim-mode (or
Vim-like-mode) as possible is the best way to train.

### zsh

zsh is my current shell right now. The magic incantation to turn Vim-mode on
for zsh is `bindkey-v`. However, just turning that on isn't going to buy you
much. In fact, it might even make you less productive because a lot of the
keyboard shortcuts that you are used to might no longer work (e.g.,
reverse-search of commands).

Instead, I suggest using zsh with the useful .oh-my-zsh framework. I have a
simple fork of at
[https://github.com/vazexqi/oh-my-zsh/](https://github.com/vazexqi/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/plugins/vi-mode/vi-mode.plugin.zsh).
I added some useful features to enable incremental search of history. The
details are in my modified [vi-mode
plug-in](https://github.com/vazexqi/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/plugins/vi-mode/vi-mode.plugin.zsh)
file. 

Enable the vi-mode plug-in by adding it to the `plugins` variable in your
.oh-my-zsh genarated .zshrc file.

{% highlight bash %}
plugins = (vi-mode history-substring-search)
{% endhighlight %} 

If you are still using bash, then I recommend subscribing to Tom Ryder's
Arabesque [blog](http://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/). He is an active Vim user
who also happens to use bash as his shell. In fact, my tip for tmux
comes from him.

### tmux

To prevent a proliferation of tabs or windows, I manage all my terminal
sessions using [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/). I won't have time
to go into all the features of tmux so I would recommend reading
[Pragmatic Tmux](http://pragprog.com/book/bhtmux/tmux) which is concise
introduction to the features of tmux.

Here are some tweaks that I put into my .tmux.conf file to make it mimic
Vim. The top portion corresponds to tweaks to simulate Vim motions for
selecting different panes. The bottom portion corresponds to tweaks to
make tmux's selection more behave like Vim. I've credited the original
authors where possible.

### Pentadactyl

<div class="media"> <a

[Pentadactyl](http://5digits.org/pentadactyl/) is a browser add-on for
Firefox that enables Vim-like motions for browsing the web. Because
browsing the web isn't exactly like editing text, there is some
impedance mismatch between some of the key mappings. But for the most
part, it's pretty intuitive. It's also one of the main reasons why I
tolerate Firefox as my main web browser. 

Chrome has [Vimium](http://vimium.github.com/) but it just feels like
_ersatz_ Pentadactyl.

If you have heard of or use Vimperator before, Pentadactyl is similar.
There is an FAQ [entry](http://5digits.org/pentadactyl/faq) discussing
the (political) differences, which  I won't get into.

There are a ton of features for Pentadactyl so I am going to list my top
**three**.

1. Follow hints: Type 'f' on your keyboard and all links are immediately
marked with unique key sequences. Typing out a key sequence (very short;
about 2 characters) will open that link. For more information, see this
help [entry](http://5digits.org/help/pentadactyl/hints.xhtml).

1. Quickmarks: Assign one character shortcut keys to your favorite
bookmarks. For instance, I assign 'G' for Gmail. I can easily open GMail
in the current tab by executing `goG`. Or I can open it in a new tab by
executing `gnG`. `go` stands for "open in current tab" and `gn` means
"open in new tab". I have several quickmarks for Gmail, Github, Google
Voice, Facebook, Twitter, etc. This saves me tons of time each day.

1. Jump to top of page and bottom of page quickly: Just do as you would
for Vim. Hit `gg` for top of page. And `G` for the bottom of the page.
No need to use the scroll button on your mouse of hit the page up keys
repeatedly.

### Vrapper and IdeaVIM

I am bit ashamed to admit that I use these last two tools but, hey, I
code in several JVM languages (Java, Groovy, Scala) and without an IDE
with smart auto-completion of libraries, it is a pain to type everything
manually.

[Vrapper](http://vrapper.sourceforge.net/home/) extends the Eclipse text
editor with Vim-like input scheme.

[IdeaVim](https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim), is the same, except
that it works for IntelliJ IDEA.

Both of these do **not** fully emulate all the Vim shortcuts. However,
they are pretty decent. Vrapper, in particular, has an embedded version
of Tim Pope's [Surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround). If you
use Sublime Text as your text editor, then I would say that both these
plug-ins are comparable to [Vintage
Mode.](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/vintage.html).

And that's my list of tools and how I tweaked each one to behave more
Vim-like. Every little tweak helped me embrace Vim more and train my
fingers until the motions become second-nature. If you know of other
tools and how to make them behave more Vim-like, I'd be interested in
hearing more.
