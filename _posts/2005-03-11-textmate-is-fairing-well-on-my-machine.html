title: TextMate is fairing well on my machine
---
<p>
BBEdit is not being used much anymore. GVim is still unbeatable but TextMate is expressing a lot of potential. Recording macros in TextMate is simple and intuitive.
I just hate its key bindings. But there is nothing that can be done about that. Not everyone is going to appreciate it if TextMate uses mode editing just like Vim.
</p>
<p>
What I like about TextMate so far:
<ul>
<li>A real text editor for programmers.</li>
<li>Clean interface for writing macros, snippets, etc.</li>
<li>An active developer that listens to his users.</li>
<li>A rather active user base that is eager to create new bundles for different languages. I believe that there are more language bundles available for TextMate as compared to SubEthaEdit.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Some of my gripes with it:
<ul>
<li>Poor documentation</li>
<li>It is not free.</li>
<li>Some weird bugs with using it as an external editor for MarsEdit and Transmit.</li>
<li>Using it means using key bindings that are limited to a non-cross platform text editor.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<small>Note: I have replaced both <a href="http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/fugu/">Fugu</a> and <a href="http://www.webdav.org/goliath/">Goliath</a> with the excellent Transmit 3.02. It is just excellent.</small>
