title: Updated to Typo 4.1

<p>
I just updated to Typo 4.1 today. It seems to have fixed the theme issues that I was having. Either way I just defaulted to using the <i>scribbish</i> theme until there is a compliant theme for Typo 4.1.

Typo 4.2 is going to be out in the next couple of months. One feature that I look forward to is the support for multiple blogs with a single Typo instance. Hopefully the developers add the ability to easily merge existing blogs into one single instance. You can read about the rest of planned features <a href="http://fredericdevillamil.com/articles/2007/03/10/typo-4-1-in-the-house">here</a>.
