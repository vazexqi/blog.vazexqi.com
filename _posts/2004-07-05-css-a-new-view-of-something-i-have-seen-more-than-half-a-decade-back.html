title: CSS--a new view of something I have seen more than half a decade back
---
<p>
A demonstration of what can be accomplished visually through CSS-based design....
[<a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">css Zen Garden: The Beauty in CSS Design</a>]
<p>
This site has given me a new enlightenment into the things that one can 
accomplish through proper css-based design. I was particulary impressed by the ability to 
create something new while maintaining all the text--something that I knew can be done but have 
yet to see it done properly.
<p>
I believe that soon most site will follow the design zen expressed here and we would be rid
of all the tabled-alignment atrocities we see too often on other sites. This will provide the impetus
to solidify a standard for CSS that ALL browsers should support.
