And remove MovableType from my server. It was a real pain having to install it on windows on the first place. Not to mention all those stupid Perl modules that I had to obtain. Anyway, the pain is over now.

But for safety, I am going to retain the .sql files as well as the mt.cgi file that is exported directly from MovableType. That being said, I am still pretty happy with MovableType has to offer. It is a great blogging system. It <i>definitely</i> beats blosxom. Blosxom was my first blogging system and it did a rather good job at that. Problem is, there is very little support for it. And hardly anything new is being done to it.
