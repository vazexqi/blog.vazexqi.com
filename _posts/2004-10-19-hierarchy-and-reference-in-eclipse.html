title: Hierarchy and Reference in Eclipse
---
<p>
In regards to my previous post on Eclipse, I decided to take back some of my comments about it. After installing version 3.1, the speed improvement was appreciable; it is still slow but it makes up for its sluggishness by having two other features which were quintessential to my current project.
</p>
<p>
<b>Call hierarchy </b> This feature was a life-saver when I first looked at the code for Idea Incubator. There was no way I could figure out what methods were calling what methods and from which classes without this. And had I not been able to see the call relations, deciphering the code would have taken much much longer. This feature is enough to make me want to use Eclipse for all my other development needs. It is interesting that this is the first time I have seen this feature implemented in an IDE.
<p/>
<p>
<b>Show references</b> This feature is almost identical to the one above I think. I have been using both without really realizing what the differences are. Either way, I am pleased that theses tools are available at my disposal.
</p>
<p>
On a side note, the show declaration function is also equally canonical to my reading of the code. Simply by hitting F2, I am able to jump to the declaration of the function within the current workspace. And if that function is not from a class in my current workspace, for instance it could be from a .jar file which has its declarations hidden, Eclipse can also report that to me.
</p>
<p>
This along with many subtle features like "really smart" code completion for the nasty ';' and the " " make it so much easier to program and focus less on these tiny but annoying details of the language.
