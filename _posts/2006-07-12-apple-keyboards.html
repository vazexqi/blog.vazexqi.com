<blockquote cite="http://rentzsch.com/bugs/pullingADoubleShift" title="rentzsch.com: Pulling a Double Shift"> "If you have a last-generation PowerBook or a MacBook Pro, here's some weirdness for you to try out:

<ul>
<li>Fire up TextEdit.</li>
<li>Press the Q key. A lowercase 'q' results.</li>
<li>Press and hold the left shift key and press the Q key. An uppercase 'Q' results.</li>
<li>Here's were it gets weird. Press and hold both shift keys and press the Q key. Nothing happens.</li>
</ul>

In fact, when you hold down both shift keys, a bunch of keys go dead. Function keys F1 through F9 become non-responsive."
</blockquote>

<p>I have confirmed this particular weirdness and it happens in other applications as well.</p>
