title: Copyright laws threatening the iPod?How Stupid Can They Get?
---
<p>
<b>Copyright laws threatening the iPod?</b> A <i>USA Today</i> article notes that according to opponents of the Inducing Infringement of Copyrights Act in the Senate, the legislation could endanger the iPod and similar devices. "(It would) media-swap networks such as Kazaa and Grokster liable for users' actions. It also would make it easier for entertainment companies to sue tech firms for copyright infringement. Opponents say the language is so broad it could apply to makers of MP3 players, such as iPod, and CD and DVD recorders, as well as to media organizations that give consumers tips on using digital content." <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/2004-07-05-induce-act_x.htm">More.</a>

<p>Seriously, this sounds more like unprecedented stupidity more than anything. While this new law will definitely help prevent illegal distribution of copyrighted materials, its repercussions bring more harm than good to the companies that are already working hard to curb these illegal activities in the first place. This law clearly favors those who believe that the record company is trustworthy. Get a new mindset: they are not the most useful people in the world.
