<blockquote cite="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2006/07/10/a_nerd_in_a_cave.html" title="Rands In Repose: A Nerd in a Cave"> "It's an ominous name: Cave. It alludes to a dark, damp place where you are likely to be eaten by a grue. The irony is that the purpose of a Cave is not to insulate, its purpose is to germinate. I'll explain."

<i>A Nerd in a Cave</i> is one of the most interesting article I have seen in a while. In short, it epitomizes the crux of what being a programming nerd is all about. This is definitely the article to send to someone when you are sick and tired of explaining for the umpteenth time to someone else why you work the way you do.

Also, if you have never heard of a cave, you might just be interesting in making your own after reading the article.
