title: "2004: Software that are indispensable"

<p>
Here is a list of software that are particularly useful to me throughout the whole year. Most of them are not free (sad to say) but like one of the websites I visited, think of it in terms of number of pizza slices that you can buy with that money. It puts the price more into perspective. Moreover, in the event that they cost too many slices of pizza, a bootleg version is always near at hand for the desperate few.
