title: Similar to rails...

<p>
<a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> - how do you pronounce this? - seems like the python equivalent of Rails. Python, as I have heard from multiple blogs and newsgroup threads, many other implementations that are similar to the capabilities of Rails. However Django seems to be the new kid on the block. Of course, there is another competition from another Java thing called <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org/">openlaszlo</a>. Django looks nice but Laszlo looks heavy-weight. <i>Where do they come up with these names?</i>
</p>
<p>
I make it a point to stay current on this kind of technologies. Not because I like taking sides and then switching them when a new competitor comes along, but like the book Pragmatic Programmers says, it is always best to equip yourself and build upon your knowledge base. Learning Rails has made me learn the Ruby language which is an excellent language.

<p>
Nowadays, I try to stay away from "heavy" languages such as Java. Sure you <i>can</i> do all sorts of things with it. And since you can do all sorts of things with it, you need to only learn one language. Now, <i>who would not want that?</i> Again, doing everything with one language is not always a good thing. The Pragmatic Programmer book has a lot to say about this. Learning new languages is always an advantage.

Anyway, these two new technologies are worth checking out. And I will be monitoring the comp.lang.ruby newsgroup for any mention of them. All in all, taking sides is not really a wise thing to do since the platform that you use as a developer is mostly dictated by your customers and the companies you work for. So, unless you can come up with a damn good plan why you are going to use some deviant you have to stick with the <i>common</i> ground. Ah, the joys of owning your own small company.
