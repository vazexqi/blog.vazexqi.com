title: A Pattern Language for Screencasting
---
<p>
<a href="http://blog.vazexqi.com/articles/2007/09/30/on-screencasts">About 9 months ago</a>, I said that I will be looking into collecting different patterns for screencasting. So finally....
</p>
<p>
I just finished writing a pattern language for screencasting based on my experiences producing and observing various screencasts on the internet. Through my experiences I have noticed various patterns that myself and other screencasters have used. Applying those patterns would certainly help the presentation of your screencast but, more importantly, I believe that the patterns enhance the teaching-learning experience of screencasts. And ultimately that is what matters most.

Interested readers may view the patterns <a href="http://softwareengineering.vazexqi.com/files/screencast_patterns.html">here</a>. The pictures that I have included are based on software for the Mac since that is what I  use for my screencasting.

<p>
At the moment, it's a rather complete version of what I had originally envisioned for such a document. It can definitely be improved but I would like to get a version out on the web for people to read in case anyone is interested in providing feedback or suggestions.

I do maintain copyright on the document in case I ever decide to publish it at some pattern conference.
