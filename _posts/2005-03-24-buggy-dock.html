This has actually happened in the past. However it is the first time that I have captured the event in picture.
It is not easy to reproduce this bug. I belive that the only steps that can cause it involves dragging a folder quickly to the dock while removing another one. It is kind of hard to explain and I am not really sure how it happens.

So far I have not seen any other replication of this. By the way, the Finder icon will remain that way until you kill the dock via Activity Monitor or via kill -9 (pid for dock).

In this current state, the Finder icon is practically useless. If you run any full screen programs, the stupid Finder icon is the only one visible. It does not go into hiding with the dock.
