title: Writing something that can interface Stand's shelf
---
<p>
Just discovered this nice program from <a href="http://hetima.com/safari/stand.html">Hetima: Safari Stand</a>. Safari Stand extends the functionality of Safari so that it becomes more of a power browser. I am sure that Safari 2.0 that ships with Tiger will have more features but there are some features that I want to have now. Stand does a pretty good job of filling in the void. The two things that I must have currently that Safari lacks are:
<ul>
    <li>The ability to store separate preferences for different sites. There are only certain sites that I can trust to have them send a cookie to me. </li>
    <li>The ability to have workspaces. Workspaces are crucial for those times when you are surfing along some web site which you think is nice but which you are debating whether you really need to bookmark it or not. Workspaces serve as temporary shelves for sites that you might or might not need to access again.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
There was actually another feature that I would like to see in Safari and that is the ability to search the bookmarks. Quicksilver does a good job of that. And Safari Stand also implements its own search engine. I believe that it supports regular expressions as well. So that is something nice especially if you have a lot of bookmarks.
</p>

In this current version of Safari Stand, there is no command to load the sites that are stored in the shelves. Moreover, there is not clean way to manipulate those groups either. Something like the workspace manager in Omniweb 5.0 comes to mind. After some quick searching, I found that Safari Stand stores its workspaces in .plist format. So it is pretty simple to design something that can read those values. However the problem comes later when I wish to tell Safari to load those pages of the shelf. I am not sure how to "tell" Safari to load those pages except by using Applescript.

I intend to solve this problem before I go on vacation on Thursday. The current solution I have on top of my head would be to create a cocoa application that will interface Safari using Applescript. At first I tried using an XML parser for Applescript but discovers that it breaks down too easily for such tasks. Moreover I thought that the best layout would have to be a NSTableView and that would requite using Interface Builder. So Xcode really comes to mind.
