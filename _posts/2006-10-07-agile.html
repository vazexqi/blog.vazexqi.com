Don't get me wrong. I like Agile methods. I think they are better than the other heavy weight methods out there. But as Jeff Atwoods <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000694.html">mentions</a>, the real problem is not even about being agile; it's how to get people to stop using the Waterfall model. And even then, the waterfall model does work pretty well for small projects.

But as Steve Yegge has so very well pointed out, there is life outside of Agile.
