title: Broken Windows. More broken windows. And then some
---
<p>
It&rsquo;s similar to the &ldquo;broken windows&rdquo; theory of urban decay, which holds that if a single window is left unrepaired in a building, in fairly short order, the remaining windows in the building will be broken. Fixing windows as soon as they are broken sends a message: that vandalism will not be tolerated. But not fixing windows also sends a message: that vandalism is acceptable. Worse, once a problem such as vandalism starts, if left unchecked, it flourishes.

<p>That was the phrase that struck it into to me. And I hope eventually to everyone using windows out there. The article that brought this to my attention can be found at <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2004/06/broken_windows">daring fireball::broken windows</a>. A critical site that is pretty much mac oriented, it has earned a spot in my RSS feed subscription.

<p>Well, enough digression. The gist of this article shows that I have always suspected: that Windows users are so used to various system attacks that they have developed a strong tolerance for them. You do not see many Windows users taking a stand against spyware. Why? One reason would be because they get infected by them while doing some best kept secret shenanigans. Thus, rather than risk some harmful publicity, they choose to suffer in silence. But I digress yet again. The main reason would be because there is so little that they can do about it. You think that the spyware developers would kindly include an unistaller in the thing? Heck, the spyware evil-doers know that for the aforementioned reason that you will never complain to anyone since you got infected thought your illegal deeds in the first place.
</p>
<p>And another sad thing: if you ever ask a windows user why don't they get that annoying thing fixed, they will promptly answer that there is nothing that they can do about it. After all, isn't the computer subjected to wear and tear from the user? Indeed it is, but to have the computer crippled by the everyday use of a common user ( not even a power user that tinkles with everything ) seems like a sad situation. The solution? Instead of saying something brash such as switch to another OS, I would strongly suggest that you do the next best thing and direct you to <a href="http://www.rixstep.com/2/20040702,00.html">this article</a>. Or if you would like another more critical look at this issue, what about <a href="http://www.rixstep.com/1/20040514,00.html">this article</a>?

<p>There will always be issues with computers. The problem exarcebates when it is not nip in the infant stages.
